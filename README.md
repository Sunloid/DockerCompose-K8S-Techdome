# Docker-Compose and Kubernetes Multi-Container application
This project is a full stack web application consisting of a frontend, backend and database. The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for local deployment. 

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js it communicates with the backend to provide a dynamic user interface. 
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js, it handles the API requests and connects MongoDB for data storage.
- **DataBase**: MongoDB is used as the database to store application data. 

The project leverages Docker Compose for managing multiple services locally and Kubernetes for scalable deployment. This setup allows for the easy development, testing and deployment of the application in a containerized environment, ensuring that all components work seamlessly together.
