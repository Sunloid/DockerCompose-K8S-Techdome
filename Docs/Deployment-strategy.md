# Deployment Strategy

The deployment of this project involves setting up a local Kubernetes cluster and deploying three main components: the frontend, backend, and MongoDB database. The process begins with ensuring all Docker images are built and available locally. A dedicated namespace is created within the Kubernetes cluster to organize and isolate resources. Each component is deployed using separate deployment YAML files, specifying resource configurations, environment variables, and container settings.

For service exposure, **NodePort** services are configured to make the frontend and backend accessible on their respective ports. The database is also exposed internally to allow the backend to connect. Rolling updates are utilized for deployments to ensure minimal downtime during updates or modifications. Logs are monitored continuously to ensure all services are running as expected.

This strategy prioritizes organization, scalability, and easy debugging while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. It is designed to allow seamless interaction between the frontend, backend, and database, ensuring the application runs efficiently on the local Kubernetes cluster.
